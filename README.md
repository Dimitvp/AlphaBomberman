# Alpha Bomberman
Alpha Bomberman is our course work for the C# Advanced Course May 2017 at SoftUni.bg

## Inspiration
The game is inspired by the classic Bomberman.

## Implementation
The levels are modeled as a matrix of char elements.

This implementation is based on exercise 9 â€“ Crossfire from the Matrices exerciser of the C# Advanced Course May 2017.

The implementation of the game interface uses and improves the utility classes from a previous project: [MetaPong](https://github.com/MetaDevTeam/MetaPong/tree/master/MetaPong.Utilities):
